<h2>De novo pathway-based classification of breast cancer subtypes</h2>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease for which various subtypes have been identified.
These subtypes are characterized by molecular differences which direct treatment selection.
The figure below illustrates the different subtypes together with cells found in normal
mammary development that have similar characterisitics.
The current state of art for breast cancer subtyping utilizes histochemistry or
gene expression to measure a few selected markers.
However, we expect that a classification based on molecular pathways rather than
individual markers is a more robust way to
classify breast cancer samples into known subtypes. To this end, we have developed several
pathway based predictors that were trained on samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
This web application allows to predict breast cancer subtypes for new samples, including
custom uploaded samples as well as samples found on the Gene Expression Omnibus. Furthermore,
selected pathways used for the individual predictors can be investigated.
